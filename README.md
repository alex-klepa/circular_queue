Data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end.

### Support

`circular_queue` officially supports the [currently supported Ruby versions][rubies], which tends to mean the last three major release.
As of now that's Ruby 2.6, 2.5, and 2.4.
Older Rubies, back to Ruby 1.9, *might* work, but are not officially supported.
