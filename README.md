# Circular Queue

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/alindeman/circular_queue.png)](http://travis-ci.org/alindeman/circular_queue)

**circular_queue** *requires* Ruby 1.9 or a Ruby implementation that
supports 1.9 syntax and standard library (e.g., JRuby in 1.9 mode;
Rubinius 2.0 should work if/when Mutex#sleep is implemented).

Documentation, including example use, is covered in the [API
Docs](http://rdoc.info/github/alindeman/circular_queue/master/CircularQueue).
